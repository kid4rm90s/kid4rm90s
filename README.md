# Hi, I'm kid4rm90s! 📚

### 🚀 Continuous self Learner

Welcome to my GitHub! I am currently on a journey to master the world of code. This profile is a collection of my progress, from "Hello World" to more complex applications.

### 🛠 What I'm Learning

I'm currently building my foundation with these technologies:

* **Languages:** Learning `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` (or Python/Java!)
* **Frameworks:** Experimenting with `Bootstrap` or `React`
* **Tools:** Getting comfortable with `Git`, `GitHub`, and `VS Code`

---

### 🌱 I'm currently focused on:
- 📖 Understanding how **WAZE API** works.
- ✍️ Documenting my code more clearly for others to read.
- 🤝 Looking for feedback on my early projects!
